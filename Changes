This file documents the revision history for Perl extension Text::MultiMarkdown.

1.0.0   2006-08-22T00:00:00
        - first release

1.0.1   2006-10-20T00:00:00
        - include patch from Uwe Voelker to allow setting of options in
          markdown(); also added a test case from Uwe. Thanks, Uwe!
          Also updated changelog references in POD somewhat.

1.0.2   2007-11-24T14:00:00
        - move to Module::Install and clean various things up, mostly to make
          CPANTS happy.

1.0.3   2007-11-24T20:22:00
        - way to keep me accountable, CPANTESTERS! Maybe I shouldn't have
          Test::Pod::Coverage enabled unless it actually checks out. Added some
          fairly useless stubbed METHODS to POD and moved POD around a bit.
          
1.0.4   2008-01-02T02:03:50
        - Refactor so that the processor instance has the same set of        
          persistent options as on the ->markdown method itself.
        - Change all functions to be instance methods, moved a chunk of the 
          global data to the instance. The rest will follow shortly.
        - The test suite now tests a reasonable set of the Markdown and 
          MultiMarkdown syntaxes.
        - All known options and metadata keys have been documented.
        
1.0.5   2008-01-04T18:07:57
        - Add Markdown and MultiMarkdown test suites.
        - Fix a big bug introduced in 1.0.4 in citations
        - Fix footnotes (and other small things) to match the test suite

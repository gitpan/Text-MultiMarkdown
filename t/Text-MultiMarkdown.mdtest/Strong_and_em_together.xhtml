<p><strong><em>This is strong and em.</em></strong></p>

<p>So is <strong><em>this</em></strong> word.</p>

<p>(Remember that <code>*</code> and <code>_</code> do not work in the middle of words in MultiMarkdown - too much accidental stuff with URL's)</p>

<p><em>*This is em with surrounding asterisks.*</em></p>

<p>Rigorous test of combined strong and em:</p>

<p>The sun is <strong><em>yellow and bright</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The sky is <strong><em>blue and clear</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The moon is <em><strong>full and gray</strong></em>.</p>

<p>The stars are <em><strong>Bright and sparkly</strong></em>.</p>

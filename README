NAME
    Text::Markdown - Convert Markdown syntax to (X)HTML

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Markdown 'markdown';
        my $html = markdown($text);

        use Text::Markdown 'markdown';
        my $html = markdown( $text, {
            empty_element_suffix => '>',
            tab_width => 2,
        } );

        use Text::Markdown;
        my $m = Text::Markdown->new;
        my $html = $m->markdown($text);

        use Text::Markdown;
        my $m = Text::MultiMarkdown->new(
            empty_element_suffix => '>',
            tab_width => 2,
        );
        my $html = $m->markdown( $text );

DESCRIPTION
    Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
    easy-to-write structured text format into HTML. Markdown's text format
    is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such
    as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.

    Markdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but
    specifically to serve as a front-end to (X)HTML. You can use span-level
    HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use block level
    HTML tags (like <div> and <table> as well).

SYNTAX
    This module implements the 'original' Markdown markdown syntax from:

        http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

OPTIONS
    Text::Markdown supports a number of options to it's processor which
    control the behaviour of the output document.

    These options can be supplied to the constructor, on in a hash with the
    individual calls to the markdown method. See the synopsis for examples
    of both of the above styles.

    The options for the processor are:

    empty element suffix
        This option can be used to generate normal HTML output. By default,
        it is ' />', which is xHTML, change to '>' for normal HTML.

    tab_width
        Controls indent width in the generated markup, defaults to 4

    markdown_in_html_blocks
        Controls if Markdown is processed when inside HTML blocks. Defaults
        to 0.

METHODS
METHODS
  new
    A simple constructor, see the SYNTAX and OPTIONS sections for more
    information.

  markdown
    The main function as far as the outside world is concerned. See the
    SYNOPSIS for details on use.

  urls
    Returns a reference to a hash with the key being the markdown reference
    and the value being the URL.

    Useful for building scripts which preprocess a list of links before the
    main content. See t/05options.t for an example of this hashref being
    passed back into the markdown method to create links.

OTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS
    Markdown has been re-implemented in a number of languages, and with a
    number of additions.

    Those that I have found are listed below:

    C - <http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount>
        Discount - Original Markdown, but in C. Fastest implementation
        available, and passes MDTest. Adds it's own set of custom features.

    python - <http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/>
        Python Markdown which is mostly compatible with the original, with
        an interesting extension API.

    ruby (maruku) - <http://maruku.rubyforge.org/>
        One of the nicest implementations out there. Builds a parse tree
        internally so very flexible.

    php - <http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/>
        A direct port of Markdown.pl, also has a separately maintained
        'extra' version, which adds a number of features that were borrowed
        by MultiMarkdown.

    lua - <http://www.frykholm.se/files/markdown.lua>
        Port to lua. Simple and lightweight (as lua is).

    haskell - <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>
        Pandoc is a more general library, supporting Markdown,
        reStructuredText, LaTeX and more.

    javascript - <http://www.attacklab.net/showdown-gui.html>
        Direct(ish) port of Markdown.pl to JavaScript

THIS DISTRIBUTION
    Please note that this distribution is a fork of John Gruber's original
    Markdown project, and it *is not* in any way blessed by him.

    Whilst this code aims to be compatible with the original Markdown.pl
    (and incorporates and passes the Markdown test suite) whilst fixing a
    number of bugs in the original - there may be differences between the
    behaviour of this module and Markdown.pl. If you find any differences
    where you believe Text::Markdown behaves contrary to the Markdown spec,
    please report them as bugs.

    Text::Markdown *does not* extend the markdown dialect in any way from
    that which is documented at daringfireball. If you want additional
    features, you should look at Text::MultiMarkdown.

        my $html = markdown($text);

        use Text::MultiMarkdown 'markdown';
        my $html = markdown( $text, {
            empty_element_suffix => '>',
            tab_width => 2,
            use_wikilinks => 1,
        } );

        use Text::MultiMarkdown;
        my $m = Text::MultiMarkdown->new;
        my $html = $m->markdown($text);

        use Text::MultiMarkdown;
        my $m = Text::MultiMarkdown->new(
            empty_element_suffix => '>',
            tab_width => 2,

        my $html = $m->markdown( $text );

DESCRIPTION
    Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
    easy-to-write structured text format into HTML. Markdown's text format
    is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such
    as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.

    Markdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but
    specifically to serve as a front-end to (X)HTML. You can use span-level
    HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use block level
    HTML tags ("<div>", "<table>" etc.). Note that by default Markdown isn't
    interpreted in HTML block-level elements, unless you add a "markdown=1""
    attribute to the element. See Text::Markdown for details.

    This module implements the MultiMarkdown markdown syntax extensions
    from:

        http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/

SYNTAX
    For more information about (original) Markdown's syntax, see:

        http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

    This module implements MultiMarkdown, which is an extension to
    Markdown..

    The extension is documented at:

        http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/

    and borrows from php-markdown, which lives at:

        http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/

    This documentation is going to be moved/copied into this module for
    clearer reading in a future release..

OPTIONS
    MultiMarkdown supports a number of options to it's processor which
    control the behaviour of the output document.

    These options can be supplied to the constructor, on in a hash with the
    individual calls to the markdown method. See the synopsis for examples
    of both of the above styles.

    The options for the processor are:

    use_metadata
        Controls the metadata options below.

    strip_metadata
        If true, any metadata in the input document is removed from the
        output document (note - does not take effect in complete document
        format).

    empty element suffix
        This option can be used to generate normal HTML output. By default,
        it is ' />', which is xHTML, change to '>' for normal HTML.

    img_ids
        Controls if <img> tags generated have an id attribute. Defaults to
        true. Turn off for compatibility with the original markdown.

    heading_ids
        Controls if <hX> tags generated have an id attribute. Defaults to
        true. Turn off for compatibility with the original markdown.

    bibliography_title
        The title of the generated bibliography, defaults to 'Bibliography'.

    tab_width
        Controls indent width in the generated markup, defaults to 4

    disable_tables
        If true, this disables the MultiMarkdown table handling.

    disable_footnotes
        If true, this disables the MultiMarkdown footnotes handling.

    disable_bibliography
        If true, this disables the MultiMarkdown bibliography/citation
        handling.

    disable_definition_lists
        If true, this disables the MultiMarkdown definition list handling.

    A number of possible items of metadata can also be supplied as options.
    Note that if the use_metadata is true then the metadata in the document
    will overwrite the settings on command line.

    Metadata options supported are:

    document_format
    use_wikilinks
    base_url
    self_url - The document url is prepended to the "#" anchor of footnotes.

METADATA
    MultiMarkdown supports the concept of 'metadata', which allows you to
    specify a number of formatting options within the document itself.
    Metadata should be placed in the top few lines of a file, on value per
    line as colon separated key/value pairs. The metadata should be
    separated from the document with a blank line.

    Most metadata keys are also supported as options to the constructor, or
    options to the markdown method itself. (Note, as metadata, keys contain
    space, whereas options the keys are underscore separated.)

    You can attach arbitrary metadata to a document, which is output in HTML
    <META> tags if unknown, see t/11document_format.t for more info.

    A list of 'known' metadata keys, and their effects are listed below:

    document format
        If set to 'complete', MultiMarkdown will render an entire xHTML
        page, otherwise it will render a document fragment

        css Sets a CSS file for the file, if in 'complete' document format.

        title
            Sets the page title, if in 'complete' document format.

    use wikilinks
        If set to '1' or 'on', causes links that are WikiWords to
        automatically be processed into links.

    base url
        This is the base URL for referencing wiki pages. In this is not
        supplied, all wiki links are relative.

METHODS
  new
    A simple constructor, see the SYNTAX and OPTIONS sections for more
    information.

  markdown
    The main function as far as the outside world is concerned. See the
    SYNOPSIS for details on use.

THIS DISTRIBUTION
    Please note that this distribution is a fork of Fletcher Penny's
    MultiMarkdown project, and it *is not* in any way blessed by him.

    Whilst this code aims to be compatible with the original MultiMarkdown
    (and incorporates and passes the MultiMarkdown test suite) whilst fixing
    a number of bugs in the original - there may be differences between the
    behaviour of this module and MultiMarkdown. If you find any differences
    where you believe Text::MultiMarkdown behaves contrary to the
    MultiMarkdown spec, please report them as bugs.

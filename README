DESCRIPTION
    Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
    easy-to-write structured text format into HTML. Markdown's text format
    is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such
    as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.

    Markdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but
    specifically to serve as a front-end to (X)HTML. You can use span-level
    HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use block level
    HTML tags (like <div> and <table> as well).

    For more information about Markdown's syntax, see:
